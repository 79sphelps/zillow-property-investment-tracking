This application shows how to work with the node-zillow package APIs. It uses a handful of useful APIs to track property information such as zestimates (assessed values), comparable properties, up-to-date property information, appreciation, rent estimates, and other useful details. 

The app uses React.js, Redux, and Bootstrap React on the client-side and Node.js/Express server-side.
