This React app is an older project I started a few years ago that is helpful for property owners and investors. It needs to be overhauled as I've not touched it in a long time. The app shows how to work with the node-zillow package APIs and shows how to utilize the package to track property information such as zestimates (assessed values), comparable properties, up-to-date property information, appreciation, rent estimates, and other useful details.

The app uses Redux and Bootstrap React on the client-side and Node.js/Express server-side.

Before running the application, run this in the shell:
- export ZWSID="[yourZWSID]"
